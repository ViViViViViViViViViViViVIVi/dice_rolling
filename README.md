# Dice Rolling

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a dice roller utility that has the same functionality as the built in one in 
Foundry VTT plus the ability to be used for dice pool systems such as the Year Zero Engine (TODO).

## Installation
The program does not use any additional packages though for good practise, the use of a venv is assumed.
Create a venv with ```python3 -m venv /path/to/project/.venv```. 

Activate the venv by running the corresponding activate script.

On linux you can use the dice_rolling.sh script or follow the instructions in INSTALL.md to install the program as an
application.
